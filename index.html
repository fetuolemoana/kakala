    <li>You are our heilala our most precious and highest ranked kakala</li>
    <li>You adorn and surround us in your perfumed scent drenched in the dew of our life force</li>
    <li>You are our kahoa strung with the words, metaphors and whispers of our ancestors</li>
    <li>You are the music of the flutes fashioned from the bones of our dead within</li>
    <li>You are a leader whose words heal, transform and restore us aloha mai aloha atu</li>
    <li>You are our sharp intellect like our fiery canoe Teresia Teaiwa </br>You both articulate our vulnerability in strength your words are salve to our pain</li>
    <li>You plumb the depths of Te Moananui a Kiwa and like our Papa Epeli Hauofa you restore and reclaim our multidimensions that remind us we navigate with ease</li>
    <li>And like Kupe you chase the wheke and help us to name our world aroha mai aroha atu</li>
